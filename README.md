# Tutorial 6

I believe I have completed all the tasks for this project. Below is a summary of the tasks and their implementations:

1. **JSF Form for Editing Project Details**
   - Implemented in `project.xhtml`.
   - This file contains the form allowing users to edit the details of a project.

2. **Database Creation**
   - Managed in `ProjectBean.java`.
   - This file includes the logic for creating a database and a table to store project details.
   - the process of create table and add date can be funded in the `Scrathces and Consoles/Database Consoles/DerbyDB/console`

3. **Storing Project Details in Database**
   - Implemented in `ProjectBean.java`.
   - The method `saveProject` handles storing the edited project details in the database.

4. **Displaying Project Titles List**
   - Implemented in `projectList.xhtml`.
   - This file displays a list of all project titles stored in the database and shows the details of a selected project.

5. **JSF Ajax for Dynamic Project Details Display**
   - Implemented in `projectList.xhtml`.
   - This file uses JSF Ajax to dynamically display project details without navigating to a new page and hides the currently displayed details when another project title is clicked.


In the mean time, I’ve attached a Video file to demonstrate the function I’ve achieved.
